= MES-1 Quadcopter Project

In this project (A first Semester Master Studies at FH Technikum Wien) a remote controller  is implemented for Infineon’s https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/applications/consumer/multicopters/[flying-PCB] quadcopter.
Furthermore, there exists an Android app that can be used to fly the pcb.

== Hardware Overview
The remote controller’s hardware platform must be the TM4C1294NCPT used throughout this course.
You will use the RN4678 dual mode bluetooth transceiver already housing a complete bluetooth 4.2 and
bluetooth low energy stack that is interfaced via UART to talk to the flying PCB. The flying PCB’s
firmware wants you to use the http://myrobotlab.org/service/multiwii[MULTI WII] flight controller protocol. Additional documentation regarding
the communication protocol to can be found http://www.multiwii.com/wiki/index.php?title=Multiwii_Serial_Protocol[here]. The user interface will be realized
using a Texas Instruments Educational Boosterpack MKII offering various interface capabilities.
